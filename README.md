## Explanation

Busy weekend, but wanted to see what Claude Opus could throw towards the weekly challenge.
The map and transitions are based on Mike Bostocks d3js templates : https://observablehq.com/@d3/world-map?intent=fork

The inital goal was to create optimally distant locations from a starting point. 
I wanted to include height, accessibility an distance to society as parameters for the exact location.
However, I've included them only as hints in this iteration.

For distance calculation I've used a Fibonacci Lattice, with interpretable steps. 
Not optimised, but sufficient for the visualization.

## Caveat

The code has not been optimized for anything other than direct display. 
It is not mobile-friendly. It is not clean. It is not DRY. It is *working*.
